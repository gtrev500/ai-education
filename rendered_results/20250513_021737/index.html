            <h2>Prompt</h2>
            <p>You are tasked with addressing misconceptions that large language models are merely "sophisticated text generators" or "party tricks" without substantial practical utility. Create a comprehensive response that:

1. Analyze 3-4 common misconceptions about LLMs (including technical limitations and capabilities), explaining both the kernel of truth and the overlooked realities in each. Focus on misconceptions about depth of reasoning, understanding context, and practical application.

2. Demonstrate 3 specific prompting strategies that transform LLM interactions from basic Q&A into powerful problem-solving tools. For each strategy:
   - Name and explain the technique
   - Provide a concrete example showing implementation
   - Explain why this approach accesses deeper capabilities

3. Present a detailed case study on using an LLM to analyze a student essay for critical thinking elements. Detail:
   - The specific problem (e.g., identifying logical fallacies, evaluating evidence quality, assessing argument structure)
   - A step-by-step prompting approach that demonstrates sophistication beyond simple summarization
   - The expected outcomes, limitations, and how this approach could complement human evaluation
   - How this application demonstrates practical utility that contradicts the "party trick" perception

4. Create a "prompting maturity model" with 4-5 levels that helps users understand their progression from novice to advanced LLM utilization, with specific examples illustrating each level's capabilities and limitations.

Your response should be technically sound while remaining accessible to non-experts, include concrete examples throughout, and specifically address how effective prompting unlocks capabilities that appear to transcend simple pattern matching. Focus on demonstrating how strategic prompting reveals the practical utility and depth of these systems for educators and other professionals.</p>
